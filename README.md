Exploring connections between audio features and lyric language in music.

This repository contains samples of a my work so far. Iâ€™ll continue to update GitHub as my project progresses. 

This project is a study of underlying correlation between lyric language, various audio features in music, and connections 
between linguistic families of language that manifest in music. Incorporating data from the several sources and tools from 
several python and R packages and APIs (detailed in the next paragraph), the project involves language recognition, text 
processing, and data visualization. 

Over four thousand songs in over forty different languages are being used so far in this study. With help from the Spotify 
Web API (for audio feature collection), Musixmatch API (for lyric collection), and the python port of Google's language-
detection library, available on Github, I was able to begin exploring the connections between lyric language and audio 
features in music. My list of songs came from published playlists on Spotify by the user *The Sounds of Spotify*. This user 
does a lot of really neat music data mapping projects, and shares them on his site: http://everynoise.com. 

I hope to continue working on this study as time allows. It would be nice if I could expand my dataset. I'm interested in 
seeing if languages of the same families are any more likely to produce music with similar audio features than languages of 
different families. Currently, linguists are actually debating over which language family contains Korean. Maybe, with what 
I find in future analysis, I will be able to weigh in.
